# Neural networks and deep learning projects

Jupyter notebooks for the three projects I implemented during the Neural networks and deep learning course from DeepLearning.AI:
- logistic_regression: an image recognition implementation of the logistic regression algorithm
- shallow_neural_network: a 2D data classification 
- deep_neural_network: refining the initial image recognition by using a deep neural network
