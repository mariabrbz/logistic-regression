# Neural networks and deep learning projects

Jupyter notebooks for the projects I implemented as part of the Neural Networks and Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks courses from DeepLearning.AI:
- logistic_regression: an image recognition implementation of the logistic regression algorithm
- shallow_neural_network: a 2D data classification 
- deep_neural_network: refining the initial image recognition by using a deep neural network
- convolution_neural_network: an image recognition of 6 signs
